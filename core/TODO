        1) digikam is not running and camera is pluged in
            -> media action dialog pops up and digikam should
               be in the list. 
        2) digikam is already running when camera is plug in
            -> as 1) but already instance should be used
            (uniconize, switchToDesktop and bringToFront applied
            if necessary
        3) digikam is started/activated after action dialog was closed and
           camera is already connected
            -> camera menu allows to 
                select the 'dynamicly added camera menu item
