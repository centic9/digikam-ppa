Notice to make release tarballs from SVN
----------------------------------------

1/ release announcements can be send to kde-i18n-docs if internationalized strings are frozen.
   The earlier the better.
  
2/ Commit changed source code files to SVN.

3/ Update the release info in digikam/CMakeLists.txt and commit it to SVN.

4/ Update NEWS file. If Changelog is a dry historical record of development, 
   NEWS should focus on the improvements and changes, summarize everything since 
   last major release. Look into ML, changelog and use BKO filter for bug summaries.
   Commit to SVN.

5/ Run project/release/release_digikam.rb script to release digiKam source tarball.
   Run project/release/release_digikam_docs.rb script to release documentation tarball.
   
   Note: the documentation must be packaged in a separate tarball to decrease the source code tarball size.

6/ When tarball is created, decompress it in a temp folder and try to compile it to prevent any problems.

7/ In tarball, Changelog file have been updated using svn2cl. copy it to your local and replace versioned 
   Changelog file. Commit to svn.

8/ Upload tarball to ftp://digikam3rdparty@ftpperso.free.fr and post a message on digikam-devel@kde.org 
   mailing list with a link to files available by http://digikam3rdparty.free.fr to have a 
   feedback from packagers before posting an official release announcement.

9/ When the official tarball is ready to post, don't forget to copy the current trunk to the tags branch
   (http://websvn.kde.org/tags/digikam/). See TAGGING below.

10/ Upload tarball to sourceforge.net area using this url (must be admin on SF-digikam):

    ftp://upload.sourceforge.net/incoming
    ...and admin file releases on sourceforge.net project page using this url:
    https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=42641

11/ Perform an official release announcement to these mailing-lists:

* digikam-users@kde.org
* digikam-devel@kde.org
* kde-extra-gear@kde.org
* kde-announce@kde.org

------------------ TAGGING ------------------

Each release has to be tagged. All tags are located in SVN in the directory /tags/digikam
You'll find the SVN revision used in the tarball in the file RELEASE.rev. You
have to do this out of your SVN graphics folder.

For a X.Y.Z.UVW release

  svn copy -r{last-used-rev_number} \
	https://{svn-user}@svn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam \
	https://{svn-user}@svn.kde.org/home/kde/tags/digikam/digikam_X_Y_Z_UVW

You also can use svn+ssh://{svn-user... instead of password requiring interface https://

If anyone knows what the purpose of this tagging is, please put it here ;-)
	* easy svn diff against released version? -- allee
	* nevermind, feel free to remove the tagging section -- allee
	* information about releases is stored in SVN database,
	  SVN history will be kept for a long time -- marcel
	* the idea of tagging comes from CVS, with SVN, you copy -- marcel
	* copying in SVN is a cheap operation, it doesn't hurt -- marcel

----------------- Branching -----------------

Branching is done, so translators can work in two separate areas and we can develop unstable and a next stable release.
To set it up, you need to do following. Remember it will take you two evenings to succeed, but you need to finish the first part completely,
because automated KDE scripts will ruin your work!

- go to /branches/stable/extragear/graphics. 
- svn delete digikam and digikamimageplugins. 
- svn cp http://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/extragear/graphics/digikam digikam  
  and the same for the plugins.

more elegant: a direct copy on the server:
$ svn delete svn+ssh://{svn-user}@svn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/stable/extragear/graphics/digikam
$ svn copy -r{last-used-rev_number} \
    http://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam \
    http://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/stable/extragear/graphics/digikam
 same with plugins

- go to /branches/stable/extragear/graphics/doc
- svn delete digikam and digikamimageplugins and showfoto
- svn cp http://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/extragear/graphics/doc/digikam and the same for the plugins and showfoto

----- this need to be done as soon as docbooks are ready in EN ---------
- go to /branches/stable/l10n/templates/docmessages/extragear/graphics
- copy over all digikam, showfoto and plugin files (don't forget the desktop files) from
  /trunk/l10n/templates/docmessages/extragear/graphics

- repeat last to steps for "messages" instead of "docmessages". No showfoto files in this case.
  (go to bed now and do the following tomorrow!) 

- to branch all the language files, you can use the script located in extragear/scripts/
- you need to do that for digikam, showfoto and digikamimageplugins. For digikamimageplugins 
  you need to specify all plugins, so you get something like:
  sh update_l10n_stable.sh --section graphics --app digikamimageplugins -u 
     toma --extrapofiles "digikamimageplugin_adjustcurves.po digikamimageplugin_charcoal.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_inpainting.po digikamimageplugin_sheartool.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_adjustlevels.po digikamimageplugin_despeckle.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_inserttext.po digikamimageplugin_antivignetting.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_distortionfx.po digikamimageplugin_lensdistortion.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_solarize.po digikamimageplugin_blowup.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_emboss.po digikamimageplugin_oilpaint.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_superimpose.po digikamimageplugin_blurfx.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_filmgrain.po digikamimageplugin_perspective.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_texture.po digikamimageplugin_border.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_freerotation.po digikamimageplugin_raindrop.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_unsharp.po digikamimageplugin_channelmixer.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_infrared.po digikamimageplugin_restoration.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_whitebalance.po digikamimageplugin_refocus.po 
                          digikamimageplugin_hotpixels.po"

- check that all plugins are copied over, last time the last one in the list did not make it.

- send a mail to the mailing-list and kde-i18n-docs.
