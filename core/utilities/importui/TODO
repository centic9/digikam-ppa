Camera Icon-view port to Qt4 Model/View port
============================================

The goal of model-view port is to be able to:

- Factorize a lots of code shared with album gui.
- Remove Qt3 dependency
- Create more powerful icon-view for camera interface, with advanced filtering option, group of items (RAW+JPEG), pre-tags options, etc...
- To be able to use preview mode in camera interface (image + video), as in albumgui.

Note: Most of these goals are full-filed from GSoC 2012 project, the remaining parts are listed below.

Relevant files from KDE bugzilla:
=================================

bug: #121310
bug: #126149
bug: #158437
bug: #161783
bug: #216491

...and certainly more files...

Import tool final TODOs
=================================================

- Implement Rating, tags, color labels (partially implemented).
- Implement Media player and Map widget (easy and partially implemented).
- Preload import item thumbs (make settings option for it, as it will be irrelevent in slow cameras).
