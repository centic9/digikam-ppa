TODO for Lensfun tool.

This is a digikam image plugin for using the lensfun library.
See http://lensfun.berlios.de for details.
This plugin is intended to be used for automatic correction
of "errors" of your used lens. However, this can only work
when your lens is known and the variances are covered in the
database.

Until now, it seems there is only data for geometry and
distortion correction in the lensfun database. This plugin
does already contain code to do the color and CA corrections,
but this could not have been tested yet.

I will get in contact with the lensfun people to see how
to follow up on this (or if I am just to stupid to see it ;)

In short, this plugin is maybe almost complete, but this
could not have been verified yet. So this plugin is not really
usefull for now and should get disabled before release, if
there is no matured database or we have added a tool to
create new database entries.
