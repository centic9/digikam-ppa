    <para>
    The &digikam; <emphasis>Emboss</emphasis> filter is a quick tool to render your images in a 3-D effect. 
    It works particularly well on images with simple structure where color is not the most important content. 
    The filter uses the difference between colors and luminosity to convert it into a grey, moon-like landscape 
    lit from 10 o'clock.
