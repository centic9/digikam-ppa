    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
    The &digikam; <emphasis>Charcoal</emphasis> filter uses the gradients of color and luminosity to 
    produce a grey scale charcoal sketch. The lines defining the outline of the image are pronounced. 
    Images with slowly changing gradients are not ideal for this effect. It is helpful to imagine what 
    scene you would pick to do as a hand sketch yourself, in order to choose the image to start with.

    <title>Using the Charcoal filter</title>

    <para>
    There are two sliders to control the effect on a scale of 1-100. The upper slider selects the pencil size, 
    whereas the second slider adjusts the contrast (smoothness).
