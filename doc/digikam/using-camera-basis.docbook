    <sect3 id="using-camera-download">
    <title>Downloading photographs to your computer</title>

        <para>
            To download photographs from your camera to your computer click the <guilabel>Download</guilabel> button on the main toolbar and then click <guilabel>Download All</guilabel> (or use <menuchoice><guimenu>Item</guimenu><guimenuitem>Download All</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the main menu). This will download all of the photographs on the camera with the settings you used with your last download (Settings tab). The download process will not remove the photographs from the camera. It is always advisable to check that the photographs have downloaded safely into the Album you were expecting before deleting them from the camera.
        </para>

        <para>
            If you do not want to download all of the photographs you can select just those that you need using the standard selection methods. Once you have the photographs selected, click <guilabel>Download</guilabel> and then <guilabel>Download Selected</guilabel>. The <guilabel>Download Selected</guilabel> button will be grayed out until you have selected some photographs.
        </para>

        <para>
            Another option is <guilabel>Download new</guilabel>. New images are marked with a star in the upper right corner of the image icon. Once images are downloaded a "downloaded already" entry will be made in the &digikam; database and they are marked with a checker. Obviously, if you choose this handy option, it will download the new images only.

    <title>Deleting photographs from the camera</title>

        <para>
            Once you are happy with the downloaded photographs that you wanted, you are ready to delete photographs from the Camera. You can delete all of the photographs at once by clicking the <menuchoice><guimenu>Item</guimenu><guimenuitem>Delete All</guimenuitem></menuchoice> button. If you just want to delete a selection of the photographs, you have to select those that you want to delete and click <menuchoice><guimenu>Item</guimenu><guimenuitem>Delete Selected</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. You may also select <menuchoice><guimenu>Item</guimenu><guimenuitem>Delete New</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, for example if you feel that the images marked with the star are not worth downloading.
        </para>

        <caution><para>
            Please note that there is no way to restore a photo that you have deleted from the camera. The photographs are not moved to the internal Trash Can, they are removed completely. It is best to double check that you have successfully downloaded a photograph into a &digikam; album before you delete it from the camera. Anyway, if you plan to empty the camera card, you better do that from the camera menu because it is much quicker.
