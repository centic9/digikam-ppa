        <title>Encoding Depth</title>

        <para>
            Here you can change the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image.
            8 bit encoding is the common JPEG format, 16 bit encoding is better suited for high quality images,
            but this format needs more storage space, calculation time and is currently available with 
            PNG, PGF, TIFF, and JPEG-2000 formats only.
