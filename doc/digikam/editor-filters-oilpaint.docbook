    <title>Using the Oil Paint filter</title>

    <para>
    There are two sliders to control the effect. The upper slider selects the <guilabel>Brush Size</guilabel> 
    between 1 and 5. Bigger brushes are better suited for large images. <guilabel>Smooth</guilabel> controls 
    the smoothness or, seen from the other end, the jaggedness.
