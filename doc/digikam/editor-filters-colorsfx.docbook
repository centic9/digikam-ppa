    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
        In the age of chemical image processing, solarizing (also known as Sabatier) was an effect created by
        exposing a partially developed print to a brief flash of light, then completing the development.
        The colored, darker areas shield the additional light from the sensitive photo layers, which has
        the net effect of making the lighter areas darker and colors being inverted during the second exposure.
        The result resembles a partially negative image. The tool allows to adjust the interesting effect smoothly.

        <title>The Solarization Effect</title>

        <para>
            The <guilabel>Intensity</guilabel> control helps to preview the solarization by simply increasing it.
            At about 50% intensity the image shows what was once chemically possible. If you further increase the
            effect it will finally become a negative image, a stage of inversion not achievable on photographic paper.
        </para>

        <para>
            This is an example of solarization effect. The original image is (1) and the corrected image is (2).
            The <guilabel>Intensity</guilabel> level applied is 30%.

        <title>The Vivid Effect (Velvia filter)</title>

        <para>
            The vivid filter simulates what is known as &quot;Velvia&quot; effect. It is different from saturation in that it has a more pronounced contrast effect that bring colors brilliantly alive and glowing. Try it, it renders beautiful for many subjects!
        </para>

        <para>
            Velvia is a brand of daylight-balanced color reversal film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. The name is a contraction of &quot;Velvet Media&quot;, a reference to its smooth image structure. Velvia has very saturated colors under daylight, high contrast. These characteristics make it the slide film of choice for most nature photographers. Velvia's highly saturated colors are, however, considered overdone by some photographers, especially those who don't primarily shoot landscapes.

        <title>The Neon Effect</title>

        <para>
            The neon filter simulates neon light along the contrast edges. The level parameter controls the lightness of the result, whereas the interaction slider determines the thickness of the neon light. With big images, the filter might eat the CPU time for a moment.
