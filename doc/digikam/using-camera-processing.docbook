        <title>File Renaming Options</title>

        <para>
            Cameras often do not use very meaningful filenames for photographs. The filenames are usually reused once the photographs have been deleted from the camera. This can lead to filename clashes if you download photographs from many shootings into the same Album. It can also be useful to include the date and time that an image was taken into the filename.

        </para>

        <para>
            If you select <guilabel>Camera filenames</guilabel> the image filenames will not be altered. But you have the option to change their case to upper or lower case with the <quote>Change case to:</quote> drop down field. If you select <guilabel>Customize</guilabel> you will be able to put together a renaming pattern from the Options drop down menu which contains original file name, file extension, owner and group, directory, a dialog for defining a sequence number and a dialog for adding date and time information, either fixed or based on the time information written by the camera into the image file.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            In the sequence number dialog you will find two options: <guilabel>Extension aware numbering</guilabel> and <guilabel>Folder aware numbering</guilabel>. If they are checked &digikam; will start a new sequence for every file extension and / or folder.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            The Date &amp; Time dialog looks like this:

            </inlinemediaobject>
        </para>

        <para>
            The calendar is active only if <quote>Fixed Date</quote> is selected from the <guilabel>Source:</guilabel> drop down field. This way you can add the same date and time information to the filenames of all imported images or videos. If <quote>Image</quote> is selected instead &digikam; will use the time information from the metadata of the image files. With the <guilabel>Format:</guilabel> drop down field you can choose from several standard date/time formats and a custom format. For the latter choose <guilabel>Custom</guilabel> in <guilabel>Format:</guilabel> drop-down list and fill in for example "dd.MM.yyyy hh:mm:ss". For more information, read <ulink url="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtcore/qdatetime.html#toString">QDateTime</ulink> class reference.

            In addition these options can be customized further with the help of a number of modifiers. A list of all options and modifiers together with a short explanations will open when clicking the info button.

                The sequence number may be needed if you have a camera with a very fast multi-shoot mode where it is possible to get two photographs with exactly the same data and time.
            </para>
        </tip>

        <para>
            The new filename that &digikam; will use for the photographs when they are downloaded is shown underneath the thumbnail in the image icon. The renaming settings will be remembered the next time you use the camera interface.

        <para>
            Check <guilabel>Extension-based sub-albums</guilabel> and &digikam; will create subalbums based on the file extensions of the imported images in the target album. &digikam; will open a dialog where you can choose the target album once you click one of the download options either from the toolbar or from the Item menu. If you want to create a new Album, into which you could download the photographs, click the <guilabel>New Album</guilabel> button. The new Album will be created as a sub-folder of the Album that is currently selected in the existing Album list. This means that if you do not want your new Album to be a sub-folder of an existing folder you must first select the collection where you want to create the new album. Collections are indicated by the

        <para>
            If your camera provides information about the date of the photograph's taking or, if you import from a USB device or a folder, the images contain EXIF metadata with date/time information, &digikam; can use this to automatically create subalbums in the target album during import. Subalbums names will be based on the image dates. All images which have the same date will be downloaded into the same subalbum if you check <guilabel>Date-based sub-albums</guilabel>. Not all cameras include this information. See the <link linkend="using-sidebar-metadata">sidebar Metadata</link> section for more detail about information your camera may have embedded in your photographs.
