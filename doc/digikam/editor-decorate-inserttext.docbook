        <para>
        This tool seems very intuitive to use. Type in your text and place it with the mouse. Use the block settings as you please. Choose the orientation, color from a color space, and fonts with all their properties. You will have to scale the font size to the image size, the larger the image, the larger the font has to be!
        Finally choose to add a border around the text and/or a semitransparent background. Voil√†, it's finished!
        </para>

        <para>
        Any text setting you have chosen can always be changed as long as you don't click the OK button. In saved and reloaded images the text has become part of the image, it cannot be changed anymore.
